Sample Code from My New Book, [Learning Virtual Reality](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Virtual-Reality-Experiences-Applications/dp/1491922834)

The files in here support the material in Chapter 7: Unity3D source files and assets for creating a panoramic photo viewer. 

To get the source for the WebVR examples described in Chapter 5, please visit my [WebVR Examples Project](https://github.com/tparisi/WebVR).

The panorama photos used in Chapter 7 were taken by Jason Marsh, super-programmer and sometimes photographer. They are free to use in any non-commercial or commercial project, with attribution: "Panoramic photos by Jason Marsh, used by permission, copyright 2015".
